# The Go++ Programming Language

Go++ is a derivative of the popular open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple,
reliable, and efficient software, named go, and sometimes referred to as golang. The basic idea is to enhance the basic language with support for classes (sort of a hybrid between structs and interfaces), and to improve the usability and readability by adding new keywords and simplifying some of the syntax.

### Download and Install

To give Go++ a spin, you will need to download the source files from github and build a new version of the compilers and related tools. First, clone a copy of the guthub repository: 

```
> git clone https://github.com/oslib/gopp.git go++
```
This step is exactly the same on the three supported platforms, Linux, Mac, and Windows. The "go++" directory can be any local name or, if omitted, it will default to the git supported name "gopp" (git does not support the "++" special characters when naming repositories).
